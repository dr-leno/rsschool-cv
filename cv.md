### About me
I am a biochemist turned frontend developer. The university and neuroscience course taught me how to learn, and programming teaches me how to apply. During the biochemistry course you just learn a reaction, then the pathway of this reaction that is involved an another connected pathway - a lot of theory. When you learn programming languages you still need a theory - but then practice, practice, practice - another mindset. The large key aspect in the frontend that I like is an opportunity to apply rational thinking in my work and at the same time see a concrete visual result. I believe that I have finally found a field that I am genuinely passionate about.\
